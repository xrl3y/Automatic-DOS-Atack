## Features

- **Flexible Targeting**: Specify either an IP address or a domain name.
- **Multiple Attack Types**: Choose between SYN, UDP, ICMP, or a combination of all.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Set the target port and the interval between packets.
- **Error Handling**: Validates input parameters to ensure correct usage.
- **User-Friendly Help**: Displays usage instructions and options when requested.

## Requirements
